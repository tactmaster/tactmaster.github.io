3. Continue adding a little water at a time until you have a soft - not sticky - dough.
4. Use oil to grease the work surface and turn out dough.
5. Fold edges into middle of the dough a few times so it is coated in oil.
6. Knead for 4-5 minutes until dough is smooth and stretchy.
7. Oil mixing bowl, put dough back in and cover with a towel to prove for about 1 hour.
8. Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a floured surface and knead it firmly a bit.
9. Smooth into a round loaf shape and put on a lined baking tray.
10. Cover with a towel and leave for about 1 hour again.
11. Preheat oven to 200Â°C with an empty roasting tin in the bottom of the oven.
12. Sprinkle some flour on top of the loaf and gently rub it in.
13. Make a few shallow cuts on top of the loaf.
